Install and test both MIT Kerberos and [Kerberised NetCat](http://oskt.secure-endpoints.com/knc.html) on [TravisCI](https://travis-ci.com).

Perhaps not particularly useful alone, but provides a good place to start if you have software which relies upon these technologies that has unit tests which you might want to run on TravisCI.
